# 30 Days of Javascript
## Goal to do this
I am doing this to learn JS and improve & strengthen my knowledge in it. Here I use the starter files provided and do the task required. Below I will mention what I learned in each day of the challenge.
### Day 1
- Learned about keyCode used in the keydown event and how to check conditions for each.
- To rewind the audio to start each time the notes is played.
- Use of 'transitioned' event for figuring out when some chenges have been ended.
